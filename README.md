This project uses the RxJS (https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/) library to create a reuseable http data fetching component in the style of the Apollo Client Query component (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/essentials/queries.html).

In addition to fetching data, the HttpQuery component can be used to dynamically poll an http endpoint. The component is stored in HttpQuery.js and an example useage can be found in App.js.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
